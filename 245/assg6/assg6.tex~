\section*{Summary}

\begin{enumerate} [a)]

  \item Level construction is working - with the exception of traps.

  \item Levels are being drawn correctly including animates/inanimates.

  \item Movement between levels works (right now with even when not on stairs).

  \item Most of the code is written for all the classes, the
    interaction between them is mostly all that's left.

\end{enumerate}
