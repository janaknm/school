\section*{Introduction}

Thinking and working through problems this quarter has made been very
satisfying. Challenge has been very prominent in just about every
aspect of this course. Not only have the actual problems been
difficult, but keeping my time managed while not losing quality has
been as well. Trying to wrap my head around problems in this class was
at first intimidating, but throughout the quarter I've developed a
toolset and way of thinking that makes them much more managable.

\section*{Class Participation}

\begin{enumerate}[]

\item After a rather tough bi-weekly assignment, I was chosen to
  present and explain the idea behind one of my solutions to the
  class. This is easier said than done.  Actually getting up in front
  of a full class and trying to convey a hard-to-visualize thought is
  a bit nerve-racking. Luckily, I noticed that `excellent' was written
  (and underlined twice!) next to my solution, so I was nearly
  positive I was going up. Knowing in advance gave me a bit of time to
  mentally prepare, but I don't have much experience in front of a
  class.

\item My solution was 'excellent' for the reason that I made sure to
  not use any assumptions without showing they were true. The problem
  was a divide and conqueror algorithm, but to prove that you could
  split the problem in half relied on an extra piece of information
  that I provided.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Asymptotic Notation}

\begin{enumerate}[]

\item 'Big-O' notation wasn't brand new to me coming in to this class,
  but my understanding was at a very simple level. It is generally
  easy to analyze basic algorithms like for loops, but I came to
  appreciate Big-O when analyzing more complicated forms like
  recursion.

\item Worst case running time has become pretty much second nature

\end{enumerate}
