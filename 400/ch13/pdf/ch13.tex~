\section{Uncertainty}
\begin{enumerate}[]
  
  \item In real-world systems, decisions can't be made so simply as
    those in closed, hypothetical environments. As soon as an agent
    ventures out of the safety of discreteness and full observability,
    things get a bit more complex. In this new scenario, the results
    of its actions can't be determined until they have actually been
    executed, introducing risk. Even actions as basic as movement can
    have unforeseen consequences in an uncertain environment. Plans of
    action can not be generated by walking through a search tree,
    because the results of one action have probabilistic
    repercussions..
    
  \item Presented in this chapter, are two modes of probability
    representation: prior probability and conditional
    probability. Definitions of such are directly related to their
    names; prior probability denotes the agent's belief that some
    event is true with absolutely no other knowledge of the
    environment. On the other hand, conditional probability is the
    belief is an event is true given some set of previous knowledge.
