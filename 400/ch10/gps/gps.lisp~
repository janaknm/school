;;;;; Matt Forbes - CS 400
;;;;; GPS - General Problem Solver
;;;;; This is highly based off an example in Norvig's AI in Common Lisp book

;;;; The GPS is a XXXX---ends to means--XXXX solution to planning
;;;; sequence of operations to attain a desired state. In other words,
;;;; this algorithm works from the goal back to the current state,
;;;; determining if it's feasible along the way.

;;;; Operations have a set of preconditions that must be satisfied, as
;;;; well as a set of conditions that are added and removed from the
;;;; state after the operation has been executed.

;;;; States are represented by a set of conditions starting with the
;;;; dummy condition STATE that currently hold in the world, and a
;;;; reversed list of actions that were required to get to that state
