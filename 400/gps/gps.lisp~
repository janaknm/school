;;;;; GPS - General Problem Solver
;;;;; This is highly based off an example in Norvig's AI in Common Lisp book

;;;; The GPS is a XXXX---ends to means--XXXX solution to planning
;;;; sequence of operations to attain a desired state. In other words,
;;;; this algorithm works from the goal back to the current state,
;;;; determining if it's feasible along the way.

;;;; Operations have a set of preconditions that must be satisfied, as
;;;; well as a set of conditions that are added and removed from the
;;;; state after the operation has been executed.

;;;; States are simply represented by a set of conditions that
;;;; currently hold in the world, as operations are executed, the
;;;; conditions from the operation's add/delete list are changed in
;;;; the state.
