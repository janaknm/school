\section*{What's Working}
\begin{enumerate}[]
  \item My server passes all the tests executed by the test scripts,
    so that's a good sign. Security is enforced by matching the
    hostname of the client to a line in the .rfahosts file. At the
    initial run of the program, a linked list of strings is made that
    can be quickly iterated over to find a match. IP addresses are
    only used in debugging messages, only the hostname is
    used. Hopefully that is the correct behavior.
    
  \item Opening files also seems to be working as expected. I haven't
    thoroughly tested that the mode passed to open is correct, but
    it's worked for everything I've tried. All the flags are being
    OR'd appropriately, and exactly one of 'R' 'W' and 'RW' must be
    present or an error is returned. Also, file names with spaces are
    parsed correctly.

  \item Reading is pretty straightforward, and has worked well as long
    as open is functioning.

  \item Write also works appropriately.
    
\end{enumerate}
