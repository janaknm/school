\section*{2.6}
A binary signal sent over a 3kHz channel with SNR of 20dB has a
maximum achievable data rate of $3000\log_2(1+100) = 19974$ bits/sec.
\section*{2.10}
Frequency is $\dfrac{c}{\lambda}$ where $c$ is the speed of light. So
with a wavelength of $1cm = 0.01m$, then $f = \dfrac{3*10^8}{0.01} =
3*10^{10}$. The lower bound is $f = \dfrac{3*10^8}{5} = 6*10^7$.

\section*{2.13}
Round-trip delay time for GEO satellites is about 270ms, for MEO satellits
it's 35-85ms, and for LEO is just 1-7ms.
\section*{2.14}
A call from the north pole to the south has to cover the distance of
exactly half the circumference of Earth. Assuming the radius is 6371km
and a perfect circle, half the circumference is $6371\pi =
40030km$. It would take light $\dfrac{20015}{1000000} = 0.02s$ =
20ms. There is about 4ms of latency for the trip up to the
satellites and back down, and require six switches between satellites,
which is another 60 microseconds = 0.06ms. So the total latency of a
call would be $20 + 4 + 0.06 = 24.06ms$.
