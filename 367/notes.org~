** Network Hardware
*** Types of Transmission
**** Point-to-point
Single sender, single receiver. The packet may be passed along many
sources before it reaches its destination. Telephone lines.
**** Broadcasting
When the communication channel is shared by all computers on the
network. packets are received by every computer, and have a field in
the packet designating the intended receiver. wifi/ethernet fit in
this category.
**** Multicasting
Like broadcasting, but only transmitting to a subset of the machines
on the network.
**** Packet
'short' block of data sent/received by network. Size of the packet is
hardware-defined.
*** Types of Networks
**** Personal Area Network (PAN)
Networks that are very short-ranged (within reach usually.) Bluetooth
is a good example, which creates a very simple master-slave network in
which all peripheral bluetooth devices connect to the master
(computer, car, etc.)
**** Wide Area Network (WAN)
WANs cover large geographic regions (countries even) and work very
similarly to LANs or MANs, just on a larger scale. In a WAN, there
will be several hosts (computers running user programs), and the
communication subnet. The subnet is a collection of transmission lines
and switches (routers) the move data between the hosts.
**** Virtual Private Networks (VPN)
Many individual networks at different site joined together to create
the effect of one large network that includes all of the users in each
network
*** Types of Connections
**** Connection-Oriented Services
Sockets and telephones work in this way. You first open a connection,
use it for some time, and finally close it when you're done. Data
transmission is done through a type of pipe, where the sender pushes
data in to the pipe, and the receiver pulls it out.
**** Connectionless Services
Rather than having a designated sender/receiver, all messages using
this type of service have the absolute address of the
recipient. Messages are routed through connected nodes in the system
until they reach their destination.

*** Internetwork
The connection of two or more networks. Internet is the best-known
internetwork.
*** Physical Medium
Peers across different machines will not directly share data. Instead,
they will pass information to the layer below it until it reaches the
bottom, the physical medium. Here is where the actual transmission
occurs.
*** Statistical Multiplexing
Networks provide a service to the connected hosts with their available
resources such as bandwidth. To be efficient, the network must have
some way to divide the resources in a way that doesn't interfere with
other hosts. Sharing the resources dynamically is called is
statistical multiplexing based on demand. 
** Flow Control
When fast-sending connections swamp a very slow receiver, flow control
is used to provide feedback to the origin of the transmission. It is
like a warning to slow dow
** Protocol
Agreement between communicating parties on how communcations should
proceed. 
** Protocol Stack
A list of protocols used by each layer in a certain system, one
protocol per layer.
** Peers
Entities that are communicating using some protocol. When a network is
comprised of multiple layers, peers would be the software or hardware
on the same layer that communicate using some protocol.
** Network Architecture
Simply the set of layers that comprise a network. A specification
should include enough information for an implementer to write the
program/build hardware for each layer so it will follow the specified
protocol.
** Service vs. Protocol
Simply put, a service is a set of primitives (operations) that it
makes available to the layer above it. It is a definition of the
operation it is prepared to make on behalf of the layer above.

A protocol is a set of rules that govern the format and meaning of the
messages/packets that are exchanged between peer entities on a layer.

Entities use protocols to implement services. For this reason
protocols can change to any degree, as long as the primitives the
service provides do not change.
** Types of Services
*** Datagram Service
This service is unreliable because there is no acknowledgement that a
packet was received. Usually there is a high probability that the
message will be received but no guarantee. 
*** Acknowledged Datagram
When an established connection isn't necessary, you can use the
datagram service but request a "receipt" that reassures the sender
that message was definitely received.
*** Request-Reply Service
A client sends a single message to the server, and it responds with a
single message response.
** Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
This is a standardized model whos structure is important, but the
actual protocols are no longer used. It has seven layers which were
designed to separate well-defined functions while keeping the number
of layers manageable. 
*** Physical Layer
Transmits raw bits over a communication channel. Its purpose is to
make sure each bit sent as a 0 is received as a 0, the implementation
is in charge of handling the mechanical/electrical aspect of the
transportation.
*** Data Link Layer
This layer is charged with transforming raw transmission of data in to
an apparently error-free line. It should hide the error-handling
implementation from the layer above, and only allow correct packets to
bubble up.

To accomplish this by having the sender break up the input data in to
data frames (some arbitrary number of bytes) and transmit these frames
sequentially. When the service needs to be reliable, the receiver must
confirm by replying with an acknowledgment frame.
*** Network Layer
Controlling the operations of the subnet is the responsibility of the
network layer. A key issue is determining how packets are routed,
which path they should take from a source to its destination. Routes
can be hardcoded in a static table, dynamically calculated for each
connection, or some medium between. 

Congestion can be caused when there are too many packets in the
subnet, and the network layer's job is to make sure this doesn't
happen. In general, the Quality of Service (QoS) is an issue of the
network layer.

Finally, sending packets between multiple networks can also be
problematic; the receiving network may use a different protocol, have
packet length limits, etc. The network layer should handle these
possible errors and correct them seamlessly.
*** Transport Layer
The transport layer communicates directly with the connected
entity. It should take data from the layer above, break it up (if
needed), and then send it to the network layer. Furthermore, it should
make sure that all the data was sent/received correctly in a way that
shouldn't be noticeable to the layers above it. The communication is
not impeded by routers imbetween like layers below, it should have a
direct line to the destination machine.
*** Session Layer
A session offers various services like dialog control (as in
conversation, whos turn it is to talk), token management (don't let
multiple parties attempt the same critical operation at the same
time), and synchronization (allowing long transmissions to be picked
up where they left off in the event of a crash or disconnect).
*** Presentation Layer
While other layers are concerned with moving bits around, this layer
dicates the syntax and semantics of that information. This is
important for computers that have different data represntations. An
abstract and standard encoding can be used and interpreted by any peer
that knows the protocol.
*** Application Layer
Here is the final layer that contains protocols that are needed and
used by actual users. For example the HTTP protocol would be
applicable, as it is the highest-level protocol used in the stack.

* Chapter 2
** Physical Layer
Information transmitted by varying some physical property. In books,
the ink varies; in wires we can vary voltage, current, etc.,
fiberoptics vary lights.
*** Bandwidth
Hardware has an affect on different frequencies, and the width of that
frequency range is called bandwidth. Square waves have a lot of higher
harmonics, but a small bandwidth removes a lot of harmonics.
*** Noise
Random variations in a signal that wasn't caused by the source.
*** Baseband
Signals from 0 to max frequency
*** Passband
Signals shifted occupy a higher frequency

** Guided Transmission Media
*** Twisted Pair
Usually two thin copper wires twisted to make give them similar
noise. If they were separated, radiation would create different
amounts of noise in each wire.
**** Simplex
One transmitter sends data across the twisted pair to the
receiver. Essentially just a one way wire.
**** Half-Duplex
One twisted pair, where the transmitter/receiver switch roles, so its
one way at a time, but the direction can change.
**** Full-Duplex
Two pairs, concurrent data in both directions.
*** Coaxial Cable
Cable TV wires, used in original ethernet.
*** Power Lines
Actually possible to transmit data across power lines, high bandwidth
but high voltage (dangerous).
*** Fiber Optics
Long haul transmission (long distance?) Different modes, single/multi
where it would be one-way or two-way. In single mode, you can send
100Gbps over 100km. 
*** Wireless
Uses the radio spectrum (10**4Hz to 10**16Hz) of frequencies. 
** Modulation
A change in signal to encode information (modulation). Extracting
information from a signal (demodulation). You can do both analog and
digital modulation. Modulation takes the carrier wave (medium of
transmission) and bends it to represent the data that needs to be
sent.
*** Amplitude Modulation
Change the amplitude of the wave to match a sine wave (for analog) or
for bit data (digital).
*** Frequency Modulation
Modifying the frequency to be interpreted as a sine wave or bit
data. For bit data you could have two frequencies, one to represent 0
and one for 1.

* Network Programming
** netlib
Simple interface for client/server communication.
** NET ASCII line
A series of characters followed by \r\n
** HTTP Format
*** Request Line:
ex: GET path HTTP/1.0
*** Response Format:
ex: HTTP/1.0 number message
    Server: <name>
    Content-Length: <bytes>
    Content-Type: <mime-type>
