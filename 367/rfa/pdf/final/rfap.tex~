\section*{Server Documentation}
My server implements all elements declared in the RFA protocol. It
passes both my tests and tests written by Dr. Nelson. The server
relies on the functions defined in netlib.h, which along with
netlib.c, should be included in the directory. There are a few ways
that the code could be cleaned up, but I'd rather not break it in the
process.

\subsection{Overview}
\begin{enumerate}[]
  \item The bulk of the program is in the function handle\_client,
    which is called by a forked process after a client connection is
    made. In this function, an array of all the open file descriptors
    is held. Rather than handing back actual file descriptors to the
    client, indexes to this array are passed. I'm not sure why I did
    this.

  \item When a client makes a request, an action is performed based
    on the first character of the message. Currently, the request
    string is parsed character by character which is something that
    could be cleaned up. 

\end{enumerate}
